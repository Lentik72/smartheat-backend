            <a href="./">Heating Oil Basics</a> → Estimating Usage & Run-Out
        </p>

        <h1>How to Estimate Heating Oil Usage</h1>

        <p>If you heat your home with oil, one of the most common questions is:</p>

        <p><strong>"How much heating oil do I actually use — and when will I need a refill?"</strong></p>

        <p>Unfortunately, most homeowners are left guessing. Tank gauges are imprecise, weather changes consumption dramatically, and running out of oil can mean expensive emergency deliveries.</p>

        <p>Here's a practical way to estimate heating oil usage — and how to make it more reliable over time.</p>

        <h2>1. Start With Your Tank Size and Current Level</h2>

        <p>Most residential heating oil tanks are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>275 gallons</strong> (most common)</li>
            <li><strong>330 gallons</strong></li>
            <li><strong>500 gallons</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your tank gauge usually shows a fraction (1/4, 1/2, 3/4), not exact gallons. As a rough estimate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 tank = approximately 60–70 gallons</li>
            <li>1/2 tank = approximately 130–140 gallons</li>
            <li>3/4 tank = approximately 200+ gallons</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This gives you a starting point, but gauges alone are often inaccurate — especially near empty. For a more precise reading, you can <a href="measure-heating-oil.html">measure oil depth manually with a stick</a>.</p>

        <h2>2. Estimate Your Daily Oil Burn Rate</h2>

        <p>A simple method is to track how long a known amount of oil lasts.</p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You add 150 gallons</li>
            <li>It lasts 30 days</li>
            <li>Your average usage = 5 gallons per day</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Colder weather = higher usage</li>
            <li>Mild days = lower usage</li>
            <li>Older homes and poor insulation increase consumption</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is why estimates based on a single refill can be misleading.</p>

        <h2>3. Factor in Weather (This Is Where Most Estimates Fail)</h2>

        <p>Heating oil usage is heavily tied to outdoor temperature.</p>

        <p>When temperatures drop:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your boiler runs longer</li>
            <li>Oil consumption increases rapidly</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is why homeowners often run out of oil during cold snaps — even if they "should have had enough." For more on seasonal patterns, see <a href="heating-oil-winter.html">How Long Does Heating Oil Last in Winter?</a></p>

        <p>Reliable estimates adjust usage based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recent burn rate</li>
            <li>Seasonal trends</li>
            <li>Local weather conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Track Usage Over Time (The Most Accurate Method)</h2>

        <p>The most accurate way to estimate heating oil usage is to log tank readings consistently and watch how consumption changes over time.</p>

        <p>By tracking:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tank level readings</li>
            <li>Delivery dates and amounts</li>
            <li>Seasonal usage patterns</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can predict:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How many gallons remain</li>
            <li>How many days of heat you have left</li>
            <li>When to schedule your next delivery — before it becomes urgent</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Use a Tool Instead of Guessing</h2>

        <p>Manually tracking heating oil usage works, but it's easy to forget readings or misjudge trends.</p>

        <p>Some homeowners use spreadsheets. Others use apps like <strong>HomeHeat</strong>, which is designed specifically for this problem.</p>

        <p>Whatever method you choose, the key is consistency:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Track tank levels regularly</li>
            <li>Note delivery amounts and dates</li>
            <li>Watch how usage changes with weather</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Over time, patterns emerge that make predictions far more reliable.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

        <p>Estimating heating oil usage doesn't have to be guesswork.</p>

        <p>With a few consistent readings and awareness of weather impact, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce emergency deliveries</li>
            <li>Plan refills more confidently</li>
            <li>Understand your true heating costs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you heat with oil, tracking usage over time is one of the easiest ways to stay warm — without surprises.</p>
