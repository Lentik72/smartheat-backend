        </p>

        <h1>How Long Does Heating Oil Last in Winter?</h1>

        <p>If you heat your home with oil, one question comes up every winter:</p>

        <p><strong>"How long will my heating oil actually last?"</strong></p>

        <p>The frustrating answer is: it depends. But with a few realistic factors, you can estimate it far more accurately than guessing from the tank gauge alone.</p>

        <h2>1. Average Heating Oil Usage in Winter</h2>

        <p>For a typical single-family home, winter heating oil usage often falls in this range:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3–5 gallons per day</strong> during mild winter weather</li>
            <li><strong>6–10+ gallons per day</strong> during colder stretches</li>
            <li><strong>Higher usage</strong> during cold snaps or extended freezes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Older homes, poor insulation, and inefficient boilers can push usage even higher.</p>

        <p>That's why oil that "usually lasts a month" can suddenly disappear in two weeks.</p>

        <h2>2. Why Tank Gauges Can Be Misleading</h2>

        <p>Most oil tanks use a simple float gauge that shows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Full</li>
            <li>3/4</li>
            <li>1/2</li>
            <li>1/4</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unfortunately:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gauges are often inaccurate</li>
            <li>Readings near empty are especially unreliable</li>
            <li>Sludge and tank tilt can skew results</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A gauge reading alone can't tell you how fast you're burning oil — only how full the tank appears at that moment. For a more accurate reading, you can <a href="measure-heating-oil">measure oil depth manually with a stick</a>.</p>

        <h2>3. Weather Has the Biggest Impact</h2>

        <p>Outdoor temperature is the biggest driver of oil consumption.</p>

        <p>When temperatures drop:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your boiler cycles more often</li>
            <li>Heat loss increases</li>
            <li>Daily oil usage rises quickly</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is why many homeowners run out of oil during cold snaps, even if they "should have had enough."</p>

        <p>Any realistic estimate must account for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recent usage trends</li>
            <li>Seasonal temperature patterns</li>
            <li>Sudden cold weather changes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. A Simple Way to Estimate How Long Your Oil Will Last</h2>

        <p>You can estimate oil longevity with this basic approach:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Estimate gallons currently in your tank</li>
            <li>Estimate your average daily usage</li>
            <li>Divide remaining gallons by daily usage</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>~120 gallons remaining</li>
            <li>~6 gallons per day</li>
            <li>= approximately 20 days of oil left</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This works — but only if your daily usage estimate stays accurate as temperatures change.</p>

        <p><em>For more on calculating your daily burn rate, see <a href="heating-oil-usage">How to Estimate Heating Oil Usage</a>.</em></p>

        <h2>5. Why Tracking Over Time Matters More Than Guessing</h2>

        <p>The most reliable way to know how long heating oil will last is to track usage consistently over time.</p>

        <p>By logging:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tank readings</li>
            <li>Delivery amounts</li>
            <li>Seasonal changes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You start to see patterns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher burn rates during cold periods</li>
            <li>Slower usage during mild stretches</li>
            <li>How weather affects your home specifically</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Over time, this makes run-out estimates far more reliable.</p>

        <h2>6. Using Tools to Predict Run-Out Dates</h2>

        <p>Manually tracking heating oil can work, but it's easy to forget readings or underestimate usage during cold weather.</p>

        <p>Some homeowners use spreadsheets or notebooks. Others use apps like <strong>HomeHeat</strong>, which is designed for this purpose.</p>

        <p>Whatever method you choose, the key is consistency. Regular tracking—combined with awareness of weather patterns—makes predictions far more reliable than gauge-watching alone.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

        <p>There's no single answer to how long heating oil lasts in winter — but there is a reliable way to estimate it.</p>

        <p>By understanding usage patterns, accounting for weather, and tracking oil levels over time, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce surprises</li>
            <li>Plan refills more confidently</li>
            <li>Avoid costly emergency deliveries</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you heat with oil, knowing how long your oil will last is one of the simplest ways to stay comfortable all winter.</p>
