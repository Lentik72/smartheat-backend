        <p style="background: var(--background-light); padding: 1rem 1.25rem; border-left: 3px solid var(--primary-blue); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <strong>If you have no heat right now:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol style="margin-top: -1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <li>Check thermostat, circuit breaker, and emergency shutoff switch</li>
            <li>Check your oil tank level</li>
            <li>Protect your pipes — open cabinet doors, drip faucets</li>
            <li>Keep one room warm — close off the rest of the house</li>
            <li>Call for service or emergency delivery</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Losing heat in the middle of winter is serious. Whether your furnace stopped working, you lost power, or you ran out of fuel, the first few hours matter.</p>

        <p>Here's what to do — and what to avoid — to keep your family safe and your pipes intact.</p>

        <h2>1. Figure Out Why You Have No Heat</h2>

        <p>Before you do anything else, identify the problem. The fix depends on the cause.</p>

        <p><strong>Check these in order:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thermostat</strong> — is it set to "heat" and above the current room temperature?</li>
            <li><strong>Circuit breaker</strong> — has the furnace breaker tripped? Check your electrical panel.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency shutoff switch</strong> — there's usually a red switch near the burner or at the top of the basement stairs. Make sure it's on.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil tank</strong> — check your gauge or dip the tank. If you're out of oil, see <a href="run-out-of-heating-oil.html">What to Do If You Run Out of Heating Oil</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Burner reset</strong> — press the red reset button on your burner <strong>once.</strong> If it doesn't start, wait 60 seconds and try once more. Do not press it more than 2-3 times.</li>
            <li><strong>Power outage</strong> — if your lights are also out, the furnace can't run. See Section 3 below.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your oil tank has fuel, the power is on, and the burner still won't fire after a reset, <strong>call a heating technician.</strong> Common causes include a clogged fuel filter, a faulty ignitor, or a tripped safety switch.</p>

        <h2>2. Keep Your House From Getting Too Cold</h2>

        <p>While you wait for a repair or delivery, your priority is keeping indoor temperatures above freezing. A house can drop to dangerous levels within hours in extreme cold.</p>

        <p><strong>Immediate steps:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Close off rooms you're not using.</strong> Shut doors, stuff towels under gaps. Concentrate everyone in one room — preferably a smaller interior room</li>
            <li><strong>Cover windows.</strong> Hang blankets or towels over windows to reduce heat loss. Even newspaper taped to glass helps</li>
            <li><strong>Stay off the floor.</strong> Cold air sinks. Use rugs, blankets, and cushions to insulate from cold floors</li>
            <li><strong>Layer clothing.</strong> Wear multiple layers, wool socks, hats, and gloves indoors. Body heat retention is more effective than trying to heat the space</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If you have a fireplace or wood stove:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use it — but make sure the damper is open</li>
            <li>Only burn seasoned wood, never treated lumber, cardboard, or trash</li>
            <li>Keep a window cracked slightly for ventilation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. What to Do During a Power Outage</h2>

        <p>If you've lost electricity, your oil burner cannot run — even if you have a full tank. Oil burners need electricity for the ignitor, fuel pump, and circulator pump.</p>

        <p><strong>Safe options:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Portable generator</strong> — can power your burner, but <strong>never run a generator indoors, in a garage, or near windows.</strong> Carbon monoxide kills. Place it outside, at least 20 feet from your home, with the exhaust pointing away</li>
            <li><strong>Space heaters</strong> — electric space heaters work if you have generator power. Use them in the room you're occupying, keep them away from curtains and furniture, and never leave them unattended</li>
            <li><strong>If you have no generator and no alternative heat source</strong>, consider going to a warming shelter, a neighbor's house, or a hotel. This is especially important for elderly family members, young children, or anyone with medical conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="background: #F8D7DA; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; border-left: 3px solid #721C24; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
            <strong>What NOT to do — these can kill you:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Never use your gas oven or stovetop for heat.</strong> This creates carbon monoxide buildup</li>
            <li><strong>Never use a charcoal or propane grill indoors</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Never run a gasoline generator inside your home or garage</strong> — even with the door open</li>
            <li><strong>Never use unvented kerosene or propane heaters indoors</strong> unless they are specifically rated for indoor use and you have adequate ventilation</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Carbon monoxide is odorless and can be fatal within minutes in enclosed spaces.</strong></p>

        <h2>4. Prevent Frozen Pipes</h2>

        <p>If your house temperature drops below 40°F, your pipes are at risk of freezing. Frozen pipes can burst and cause thousands of dollars in water damage.</p>

        <p><strong>Prevention steps:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open cabinet doors</strong> under sinks on exterior walls to let warmer air reach pipes</li>
            <li><strong>Let faucets drip slightly</strong> — a slow drip keeps water moving and prevents freezing</li>
            <li><strong>If you'll be without heat for more than 12 hours</strong> in below-freezing temperatures, consider turning off the water at the main shutoff and draining the system</li>
            <li><strong>Wrap exposed pipes</strong> in basements or crawl spaces with towels or blankets as temporary insulation</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If a pipe has already frozen</strong> (no water flow but hasn't burst):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply gentle heat with a hair dryer, heat lamp, or warm towels</li>
            <li>Never use a torch or open flame on pipes</li>
            <li>Start from the faucet end and work toward the frozen section</li>
            <li>If you can't locate or thaw the frozen section, call a plumber before it bursts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. If You Rent</h2>

        <p>Call your landlord immediately. In most states, lack of heat in winter is a habitability issue, and landlords are required to restore it within hours — not days.</p>

        <p>If your landlord is unresponsive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Document the situation (temperature readings, photos, timestamps)</li>
            <li>Contact your local building or housing inspector</li>
            <li>Many municipalities have emergency heating assistance programs — call your town hall or 211</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. When to Leave</h2>

        <p>If your home drops below 50°F indoors and you have no way to heat it, strongly consider leaving — especially if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have infants, elderly family members, or anyone with health conditions</li>
            <li>The forecast shows continued extreme cold</li>
            <li>You have no generator, no fireplace, and no timeline for repair</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Go to:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A friend's or neighbor's house</li>
            <li>A hotel</li>
            <li>A public warming shelter — call your town or county's emergency management number, or dial 211</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There is no point in risking hypothermia or frozen pipes when safer options are available.</p>

        <h2>7. Be Ready for Next Time</h2>

        <p>After the crisis passes, take a few steps so you're never in this position again:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Install carbon monoxide detectors</strong> on every floor if you don't already have them</li>
            <li><strong>Have your burner serviced annually</strong> — most breakdowns happen because of maintenance issues that could have been caught early</li>
            <li><strong>Keep your oil tank above 1/4</strong> — order a refill at half a tank so you're never close to empty</li>
            <li><strong>Have a plan for power outages</strong> — know where your generator is, keep fuel on hand, and know how to connect it safely</li>
            <li><strong>Track your oil usage</strong> so you know when you'll run low before it happens. See <a href="heating-oil-usage.html">How to Estimate Heating Oil Usage</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The best time to prepare for a heating emergency is before it happens.</p>
