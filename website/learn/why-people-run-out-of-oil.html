            <a href="./">Heating Oil Basics</a> → Avoiding Run-Outs
        </p>

        <h1>Why People Run Out of Heating Oil</h1>

        <p style="background: var(--background-light); padding: 1rem 1.25rem; border-left: 3px solid var(--primary-blue); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <strong>In short:</strong> Most people run out of heating oil because they wait too long, trust schedules that don't adapt to cold weather, or don't have visibility into prices and availability until it's urgent.
        </p>

        <p>Every winter, thousands of homeowners wake up to a cold house and an empty tank. It's stressful, expensive, and almost always avoidable.</p>

        <p>Here's the surprising part: <strong>most people don't run out because prices are high.</strong></p>

        <p>They run out because of habits—small, understandable behaviors that quietly set them up for an emergency.</p>

        <h2>1. "I'll Check It Later"</h2>

        <p>The tank gauge is in the basement. Life is busy. Checking it feels like a chore that can wait.</p>

        <p>So it waits. And waits. Until one cold morning, the heat doesn't come on.</p>

        <p><strong>Real example:</strong> A homeowner in Westchester, NY checked their tank in early December and saw it at half. They assumed they had weeks. A cold snap hit, usage doubled, and they ran out on Christmas Eve. Emergency delivery cost $200 extra.</p>

        <p>The problem isn't laziness—it's that tank gauges don't tell you how fast you're burning oil. A tank that "looks fine" today can be empty in 10 days during cold weather.</p>

        <h2>2. Trusting Auto-Delivery Blindly</h2>

        <p>Auto-delivery sounds foolproof: the company tracks your usage and delivers before you run out.</p>

        <p>But auto-delivery has limits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delivery schedules are based on averages, not your actual usage</li>
            <li>Unusually cold weather can throw off their estimates</li>
            <li>If your household changes (guests, working from home), their model doesn't know</li>
            <li>Some companies prioritize their own route efficiency over your tank level</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Real example:</strong> A family in Connecticut had been on auto-delivery for years with no issues. Then came the January 2024 cold snap. Demand spiked, their supplier fell behind, and the "automatic" delivery came two days after they ran out.</p>

        <p>Auto-delivery is convenient, but it's not a guarantee. It's someone else's estimate of when you'll need oil.</p>

        <h2>3. Waiting for the "Right" Price</h2>

        <p>Oil prices fluctuate. It's natural to want to time your order for the lowest price.</p>

        <p>But price-watching creates a dangerous pattern:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prices are high → "I'll wait for them to drop"</li>
            <li>Prices drop slightly → "Maybe they'll go lower"</li>
            <li>Cold snap hits → Prices spike, everyone orders at once</li>
            <li>Now you're paying peak prices <em>and</em> waiting 3-5 days for delivery</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Real example:</strong> In February 2025, a homeowner in Massachusetts watched prices climb from $3.20 to $3.45 over two weeks. They waited for a dip. Then a nor'easter hit, prices jumped to $3.89, and delivery windows stretched to a week. They paid $0.70 more per gallon than if they'd ordered when they first thought about it.</p>

        <p>The "right time" to order isn't when prices are lowest. It's before you need to.</p>

        <h2>4. Only Calling "My Usual Guy"</h2>

        <p>Loyalty to a supplier is common—and often deserved. But it can create blind spots:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You don't know if their price is competitive</li>
            <li>You don't know if other suppliers could deliver faster</li>
            <li>When your usual guy is busy, you have no backup</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Real example:</strong> A homeowner in Long Island had used the same supplier for 15 years. During a cold snap, they called to order and were told "3-4 days." They didn't realize three other suppliers in their area had next-day availability—and lower prices. They'd never checked.</p>

        <p>Loyalty is fine. But knowing your options isn't disloyal—it's smart.</p>

        <h2>5. No Clear Signal That Action Is Needed</h2>

        <p>Most homeowners don't need perfect predictions. They just need a simple heads-up before it becomes an emergency.</p>

        <p>But without tracking:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You don't know your actual burn rate</li>
            <li>You don't know how weather is affecting usage</li>
            <li>You don't get a warning until the tank is nearly empty</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By the time the gauge shows 1/4 tank, you might have only 5-7 days left—less during cold weather. That's not much margin for error.</p>

        <h2>What These Patterns Have in Common</h2>

        <p>None of these mistakes are about being careless or cheap. They're about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of visibility</strong> — not knowing what's actually happening in your tank</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of context</strong> — not knowing what's happening in the market</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of signal</strong> — not knowing when to act until it's urgent</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The fix isn't obsessing over your tank gauge. It's having enough information to make calm, confident decisions before everyone else is scrambling.</p>

        <h2>How to Avoid Running Out</h2>

        <p>Based on the patterns above, here's what actually works:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Track your usage over time</strong> — Even rough estimates help you spot when consumption is higher than usual. See <a href="heating-oil-usage.html">How to Estimate Heating Oil Usage</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Know your options</strong> — Have 2-3 suppliers you can call. Check prices occasionally, even if you don't switch. See <a href="../prices.html">current prices in your area</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Order before you need to</strong> — When your tank hits 1/4, don't wait. Prices rarely drop enough to justify the risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch the weather</strong> — Cold snaps increase demand and slow deliveries. Order before the forecast, not during the storm.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't rely solely on auto-delivery</strong> — Check your tank yourself occasionally, especially during cold stretches.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Goal Isn't Perfection</h2>

        <p>You don't need to predict your tank level to the gallon. You don't need to time the market perfectly.</p>

        <p>You just need to avoid the emergency—the cold house, the $200 rush fee, the stress of not knowing if delivery will come in time.</p>

        <p>That's a much simpler problem to solve.</p>
