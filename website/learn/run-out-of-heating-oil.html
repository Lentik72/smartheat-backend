            <a href="./">Heating Oil Basics</a> → Running Out of Oil
        </p>

        <h1>What to Do If You Run Out of Heating Oil</h1>

        <p style="background: var(--background-light); padding: 1rem 1.25rem; border-left: 3px solid var(--primary-blue); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <strong>Quick steps:</strong> Check if you're truly empty → Call for emergency delivery → Add 5-10 gallons of diesel as a temporary fix → Bleed the fuel line → Restart the burner.
        </p>

        <p>If your heating oil tank just ran dry, don't panic. Your house won't freeze immediately, and there are steps you can take right now — even before a delivery truck arrives.</p>

        <p>Here's what to do, in order.</p>

        <h2>1. Check If You're Actually Empty</h2>

        <p>Before assuming the tank is dry, check a few things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Look at the gauge.</strong> If it reads below 1/4, you may be very low but not completely empty.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a measuring stick.</strong> Dip a clean stick or dowel into the tank fill pipe. If it comes up dry, you're out. If there's an inch or two of oil, you may still have 5-10 gallons — enough to run the burner for a few hours. See <a href="measure-heating-oil.html">how to measure oil manually</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Listen to the burner.</strong> If it's running but cycling on and off rapidly, the tank may be nearly empty and pulling air.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're truly empty — dry stick, burner won't fire — move to the next step.</p>

        <h2>2. Call for an Emergency Delivery</h2>

        <p>Most heating oil companies offer emergency or same-day delivery, but expect to pay a premium — often $50-150 more than a regular delivery, plus a higher per-gallon price.</p>

        <p><strong>Tips for calling:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Call your regular supplier first — they may waive the emergency fee for existing customers</li>
            <li>If your supplier can't come today, call other local companies. Many will deliver to non-customers in emergencies</li>
            <li>Ask for the minimum delivery (usually 100 gallons) to keep the cost down</li>
            <li>If it's after hours or a weekend, check for 24/7 emergency delivery services in your area</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>While you wait for delivery, move to the next step — you can get heat running in under an hour.</strong></p>

        <h2>3. Add Diesel Fuel as a Temporary Fix</h2>

        <p>This is the fastest way to get heat back. <strong>#2 diesel fuel is essentially the same product as #2 heating oil.</strong> The main difference is that road diesel has taxes and a different dye. It is safe to use in your oil burner.</p>

        <p><strong>Here's how:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to any gas station with a diesel pump</li>
            <li>Fill a clean 5-gallon gas can with <strong>diesel fuel</strong> (NOT gasoline — never put gasoline in your oil tank)</li>
            <li>Pour the diesel into your oil tank through the fill pipe (the capped pipe on top or side of the tank)</li>
            <li>5-10 gallons is enough to run your burner for 1-2 days</li>
        </ol>

        <p style="background: #FFF3CD; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; border-left: 3px solid #856404; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
            <strong>Use #2 diesel only.</strong> Do not use gasoline, kerosene blends, or any other fuel unless your burner manual specifically allows it. <strong>Gasoline in an oil tank is extremely dangerous.</strong>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Rough guide — how long will it last?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5 gallons</strong> ≈ 12-24 hours (average home)</li>
            <li><strong>10 gallons</strong> ≈ 1-2 days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Actual usage varies by temperature, home size, and insulation. A 5-gallon can of diesel costs roughly $20-25 — far cheaper than an emergency delivery surcharge.</p>

        <p>This is a temporary fix, not a long-term solution. Schedule a proper delivery as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2>4. Bleed the Fuel Line</h2>

        <p>When your tank runs completely dry, air gets into the fuel line. Even after adding oil or diesel, your burner may not start because it's trying to pump air instead of fuel. You need to bleed the line.</p>

        <p style="background: var(--background-light); padding: 1rem 1.25rem; border-left: 3px solid var(--primary-blue); margin: 1.5rem 0;">
            <strong>Before you start:</strong> If you are uncomfortable working around the burner, smell oil strongly, or see oil pooling on the floor — stop and call a professional. Bleeding the line is safe and straightforward for many homeowners, but it is not required. A technician can do this for you.
        </p>

        <p><strong>What you'll need:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A 3/8" or 1/4" wrench (or adjustable wrench)</li>
            <li>A small container or rag to catch oil drips</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Find the bleeder valve on your fuel pump — a small hex nut, usually on the left side of the burner unit</li>
            <li>Place your container or rag underneath the valve</li>
            <li>Loosen the bleeder valve slightly — about a quarter turn. <strong>Do not remove it completely</strong></li>
            <li>Press the <strong>reset button</strong> on the burner (usually a red or black button on the burner control box)</li>
            <li>You'll hear the fuel pump start. Air will hiss out of the bleeder valve, followed by sputtering, then a steady stream of oil</li>
            <li>Once you see a solid, bubble-free stream of oil, <strong>tighten the bleeder valve</strong></li>
            <li>The burner should fire within a few seconds</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If it doesn't fire after the first attempt, wait 60 seconds and try again. It may take 2-3 bleeds to fully purge the air.</p>

        <p style="background: #FFF3CD; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; border-left: 3px solid #856404; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
            <strong>Warning:</strong> Only press the reset button <strong>2-3 times maximum.</strong> Pressing it repeatedly can flood the combustion chamber with unburned oil, which is a safety hazard and will require a technician to clean up.
        </p>

        <h2>5. If the Burner Still Won't Start</h2>

        <p>If you've added fuel and bled the line but the burner still won't fire:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Check the thermostat</strong> — make sure it's set above room temperature and switched to "heat"</li>
            <li><strong>Check the circuit breaker</strong> — make sure the breaker for the furnace/boiler hasn't tripped</li>
            <li><strong>Check the emergency shutoff switch</strong> — there's usually a red switch at the top of the basement stairs or near the burner. Make sure it's in the "on" position</li>
            <li><strong>Look for an error code or lockout light</strong> on the burner control box</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If none of that works, <strong>call a heating technician.</strong> Running out of oil can sometimes cause sludge from the bottom of the tank to clog the fuel filter or nozzle, which requires professional service.</p>

        <p>While you wait, see <a href="heating-emergency.html">What to Do When You Lose Heat in Winter</a> for tips on keeping your house warm and protecting your pipes.</p>

        <h2>6. Prevent It From Happening Again</h2>

        <p>Running out of oil is stressful, expensive, and can damage your heating system over time. Here's how to avoid it:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don't rely on the gauge alone</strong> — they're imprecise, especially near empty. <a href="measure-heating-oil.html">Measure your oil manually</a> for accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Track your usage over time</strong> — knowing your daily burn rate helps you predict when you'll run low. See <a href="heating-oil-usage.html">How to Estimate Heating Oil Usage</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Order at half a tank</strong> — don't wait until you're at 1/4. That leaves enough buffer for delivery delays and unexpected cold weather.</li>
            <li><strong>Pay attention to weather</strong> — a cold snap can double your usage overnight. See <a href="heating-oil-winter.html">How Long Does Heating Oil Last in Winter?</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Running out once is understandable. Running out twice is preventable.</p>
